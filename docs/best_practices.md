# Best Practices

To ensure a smooth and efficient integration of SAP HANA with Databricks, follow these best practices:

1. **Validate Data Connections**: Before running any jobs, verify that the JDBC connection to SAP HANA is working correctly.

2. **Cluster Sizing**: Choose an appropriately sized Databricks cluster based on the volume of data to be processed. A larger dataset might require a cluster with more resources (CPU, memory).

3. **Use Checkpoints for Incremental Loads**: When dealing with large datasets or recurring data extraction tasks, consider using checkpoints to facilitate incremental data loads. This connector automatically allows this.

4. **Limit Data Extraction**: Only extract the necessary columns and rows from SAP HANA. Limiting the amount of data reduces processing time and resource usage, improving job performance.

5. **Secure Sensitive Information**: Always use Databricks Secrets to store sensitive information like SAP HANA credentials, JDBC URLs, and passwords. This ensures that sensitive data is not exposed in plain text.

Following these best practices will help ensure efficient, secure, and scalable data integration between SAP HANA and Databricks.
